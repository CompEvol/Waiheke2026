## Overview:

The 29th Annual New Zealand Phylogenomics Meeting is a conference at the interface of mathematics, computer science, statistics, and biology in the study of phylogenetics, genome analysis and molecular evolution. In 2026, the meeting will again be held on Waiheke Island, a short ferry trip away from Auckland City. We will be at a new venue in Onetangi. The programme will be finalised later but talks will start after lunch on Tuesday (10th) and we will finish by lunch on Friday (13th).

Both are close to the meeting venue.
