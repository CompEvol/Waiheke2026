## Overview:

The 30th Annual New Zealand Phylogenomics Meeting is a conference at the interface of mathematics, computer science, statistics, and biology in the study of phylogenetics, genome analysis and molecular evolution. In 2026, the meeting will again be held on Waiheke Island, a short ferry trip away from Auckland City. The venue will be available Tuesday morning (10th) through to Friday midday (13th). We expect talks to start Tuesday morning  and end by lunchtime on Friday. 

## Registration:

The registration portal will open shortly. 

## Accommodation:

We recommend that you book early since February is a busy time for Waiheke Island. Popular websites that list holiday houses for rent are, for example, Bookabach and Airbnb. 

## Sponsorship:

We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Centre for Computational Evolution at the University of Auckland.
