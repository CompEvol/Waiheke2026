## Overview:

The 29th Annual New Zealand Phylogenomics Meeting is a conference at the interface of mathematics, computer science, statistics, and biology in the study of phylogenetics, genome analysis and molecular evolution. In 2026, the meeting will again be held on Waiheke Island, a short ferry trip away from Auckland City. We will be at a new venue in Onetangi. The programme will be finalised later but talks will start after lunch on Tuesday (10th) and we will finish by lunch on Friday (13th).  

## Registration:

The registration portal will open shortly. 

## Accommodation:

We recommend that you book early since February is a busy time for Waiheke Island. For  accommodation, consider [Onetangi Beach Apartments](https://onetangi.co.nz/) which is comfortable and offers some good sharing options or nice units if you are well-funded, or the [Waiheke Backpackers Hostel](https://www.waihekebackpackers.co.nz/) which is good value. Both are close to the meeting venue.
Alternatively, websites such as Bookabach and Airbnb offer a variety of holiday houses for rent.
